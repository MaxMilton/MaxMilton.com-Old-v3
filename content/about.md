Yo âœŒ

I'm Max. I'm a tech consultant currently based in Sydney, Australia. I'm always up for new experiences, love learning new things, my world is full of adventure and crazy fun times!

I specialise in Ecommerce, DevOps, Linux, and Cloud Infrastructure. I typically work with enterprise and government on large contract projects but I love working with start-ups on occasion too. To hire me for a project or consulting [contact me](#contact-me).

I also run a number of ecommerce properties via my company <a href="https://wearegenki.com" target="_blank">We Are Genki</a>. These sites are a great example of the quality of my work.
