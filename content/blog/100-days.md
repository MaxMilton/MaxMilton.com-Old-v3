When was the last time you had a good hard look at yourself and truly thought "Yep, I'm happy."? For me, well... its been a while, a real long while. Let's fix that.

To get my body and mind to a point I'm happy with, I'll<!--more--> spend 100 days cleaning out my old habits and replacing them with habits that help. This is my 100 day challenge. 100 days may sound like a long time, but in the grand scheme of things, it's totally a worthwhile investment.

## 100 Days Of:

**Note to self:** Do all this in the morning before leaving for work. Every day for 100 days _NO MATTER WHAT_. Don't worry about how long you do each thing; focus on being consistent.

### 1. Meditation

Meditate in the morning, right after waking up. Stick to mindfulness meditation and <abbr title="loving kindness">metta</abbr> meditation. Sit on a hard pillow on the floor in a quarter lotus position (one calf on top of the other) because it keeps the spine straight.

### 2. Exercise

Bodyweight <abbr title="high intensity training">HIT</abbr> exercises at home every second day. Every other day do a movement or play activity (e.g. go for a walk, play a sport, do yoga).

I need to strengthen my back. General body image is important too. Exercise to tone my body and eat healthy to lose weight.

### 3. Cooking

No eating out or buying pre-made meals, instead, cook for every meal. Eat a paleo based ketogenic diet to lose weight in a healthy way. Eat high fat, low carb, and moderate protein. Avoid carbs, gluten, additives, preservatives, and anything processed.

### No Escape

To top it all off, at all times avoid _escape activities_. Avoid YouTube, TV shows, porn, podcasts, news, blogs, needless shopping, and anything else I do to distract myself. Instead, work towards my goals.

## Let's Begin...

Is it possible to undo a life's worth of bad habits in only 100 days? My 100 day challenge begins soon. More posts to come including body before photos and an in-depth look into each aspect of the challenge. [Subscribe](/) for future posts.
