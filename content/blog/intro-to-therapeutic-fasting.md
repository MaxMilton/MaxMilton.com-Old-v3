Great talk by Dr. Jason Fung explaining how reducing insulin is the key metabolic driver to accessing energy stored as fat. Dr. Fung also goes into detail about what happens to your body during fasting and dispels some common fasting myths.

In the video he explains all this in an understandable way, even for people who may not be that interested in nutritional science. Truly interesting stuff, I highly recommend watching<!--more-->!
