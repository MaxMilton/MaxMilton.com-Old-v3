Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a [celebrity who isn't bound](#) and gagged. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? You lived before you met me?! **We don't have a brig.** When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I? __ Then later, Leela made the film.__ *But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles.* Roll film!

## You don't know how to do any of those.

You lived before you met me?! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Leela's gonna kill me. Guess again. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!

1. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.
2. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
3. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

### As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Say it in Russian! Then we'll go with that data file! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

* Then we'll go with that data file!
* Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
* I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Oh sure! Blame the wizards! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I'm a thing. Who am I making this out to?

Why would a robot need to drink? With gusto. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.

For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Why would a robot need to drink? Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Bender, we're trying our best. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Now what? Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.
