Welcome to my super duper amazing shiny new blog. I'll publish posts every once and a while about the things which I find exciting.

Those things may include<!--more-->:

* Adventure &amp; travel
* Urban exploring
* Business and customer experience design
* Ecommerce
* Web design and development
* Linux and open source
* Whatever else interests me at the time

I know blog best practice is to choose 2 or 3 subjects and stick to writing about those... but I don't work that way. I find so many things interesting, I couldn't possibly just stick to a few. I'll start writing and see where it takes me, let's let it grow organically.

Posts will be short and succinct, written in an easy to digest way. They won't be perfect, but I want to push and get my thoughts out there.

I'm not going to commit to any regular posting schedule because I probably wouldn't stick to it ;)

P.S. I have a secret to admit... there have been a few times that I've tried to start a blog but didn't end up following through. This time, I'm determined to finally hit publish.

P.P.S. If you're reading this then I've succeeded!
