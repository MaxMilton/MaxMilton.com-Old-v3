+ Tips on working from [nice] places a.k.a. the beach - how to be productive working from almost anywhere
    * Where to work - beach, parks, forests,
        - Are you driving there or catching a lift and will you have space to bring things? no car then don't bring a chair etc. check on Google maps if the location already has suitable seating/work area
    * What tools to bring - laptop, mouse and mouse pad if doing precision work (i.e. graphic design), tablet, mobile phone, backup battery/solar charger, chair or picnic blanket, insect replant, water, food, book/kindle, suitable clothing + extra in case it gets cold/hot, spare socks + underwear - if you have a car possibly bring a beach tent
        - 2+ people? spread the load, bring something to play with (ball, frizbee, slack line etc.)
    * Where to sit and set up - can you sit without a backrest for a long time? Standing 'desks'?
    * Dealing with:
        - Insects - insect replant (if it works for you, don't do much for me), wearing long pants + long sleeve shirt
        - Sand/dust/mud
        - Noise
        - Sunlight/glare
        - Other people
        - No internet access or mobile reception
    * Planning ahead - check weather conditions, Google maps/earth, prepare food, plan your route if driving (to avoid traffic)
    * Productivity techniques
        - Pomodoro technique
    * Take breaks every 2â€“3 hours - go enjoy the place, speak with a local, if overseas practice your language skills, make friends
