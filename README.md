Source for the website of Max Milton &mdash; powered by Hugo, Gulp, and Bootstrap v4 &mdash; <https://maxmilton.com>.

# Overview

A simple blog which uses Node.js + Gulp automation to make development and deployment easy. Site generated with Hugo, a fast static website engine, which makes creating websites fun again. Theme uses Bootstrap v4 to make building faster.

NOTE: Browser-sync is used to serve the site when in development &mdash; the auto-reload is awesome and makes developing across mutliple devices easy. I much prefer it over the Hugo built in server.

Feel free to use my Hugo theme as the base for your own site. I hope you like it!

Let me know if you use it, I'd love to see what you do with it!
